Plan:
- Write functions for every API request needed
- Organise the API requests, so that I can tunnel responses into the correct catergories
- Funnel responses (Organised) into holding database
- Create Validation System
- Place into Main Database

API-Football:

@Continents and Countries
- For continents and countries it all keeps track of country names

@ Teams
- Doesn't show team squad, team statistics
